      <description>In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll create a future trading bot in Golang, that will connect with a cryptocuurency exchange and start trading based on a strategy that we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in future blog posts. Since this is the first entry of this series, there is alot of stuff that we need to setup before we go deep into the exciting stuff - hopefully making some profit from cryptocurrenices üòÅ. Moreover, I have chosen cryptocurrencies for this bot since the tech behind it is pretty solid and alot of exchnages have really good documentation for developers, but this approach could also be used for any other trading platform.</description>

      <title>Docker Networks</title>

      <description>Recently, as part of a project, I deployed two backend services that communicated with each other, only to realize a noob mistake I made. In my haste I forgot the simple fact that Docker containers are completely isolated and what I was trying to do required some network configuration as well. This lead me to do some research on Docker networking modes to configure my containers accordingly, and although I was aware of some basic networking modes like bridge and host, I was certainly surprised by some newer network drivers that were available to use in the documentation.</description>
