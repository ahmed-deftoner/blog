      <description>Recently, as part of a project, I deployed two backend services that communicated with each other, only to realize a noob mistake I made. In my haste I forgot the simple fact that Docker containers are completely isolated and what I was trying to do required some network configuration as well. This lead me to do some research on Docker networking modes to configure my containers accordingly, and although I was aware of some basic networking modes like bridge and host, I was certainly surprised by some newer network drivers that were available to use in the documentation.</description>
